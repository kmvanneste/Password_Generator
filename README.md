## Description 

The page will ask the user a series of questions in the form of pop-up windows.  After the user answers all of the prompted questions they must press the "Generate Password" button in the middle of the page.  A password that meets their desired qualifications will appear in the box labeled "Your Secure Password".

## Technologies

- Minimum styling with CSS and Bootstrap
- JavaScript

No installations necessary.

## Contributions

To develop the Password Generator I worked with Carlo DeFilippis, Erin Platvoet, Ivan Zapata-Rivera, Miguel Jimenez, Andie W, and Maurya.  It was a team effort and would not have been accomplished without Carlo Defilippis willingness to share his extensive background in JavaScript.
